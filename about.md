I am a data scientist with a background in quantitative policy analysis and GIS. I am particulary interested in spatial data systems and analysis; and am an enthusiastic user of Python for data science and open-source GIS. I grew up on the East Coast where I also attended college (Williams) and graduate school (Yale). The Bay Area is now home.

I currently working at a national public health research institute where I conduct statistical analyses and manage large-scale spatial data systems that measure spatial patterns in various health outcomes. I'm passionate about using data (particularly that which can be displayed on a map) to understand and solve complex problems.

On the weekends, I can generally be found in the Sierra Nevada camping, climbing, running, and hiking. 

## Motivation for this site
I've really come to value the way that working in Python allows me to work on all aspects of a data science project within the same programming environment - data storage, spatial analysis, statistical analysis, visualization / mapping. Further, in particular with GIS (although also very true with non-spatial data wrangling), I find that using open source Python libraries as building blocks for developing customized tools and applications to be an **incredibly** useful approach. With spatial data analysis this has many advantages over the more standard "black box" use of geoprocessing tools in most desktop GIS. When tools are built from the bottom up, you have a full-understanding of what is going on behind the scenes, which leads to the ability to customize and tweak every intricate detail of what that application does so that it addresses your needs as efficiently and directly as possible. I find this process to be incredibly useful, enjoyable, and satisfying. 

In this blog, I hope to share some useful things that I learn as I continue this journey. The motivation for a particular post could be an interesting dataset I want to play with, a new library that I want to explore, or a particular problem that I want to solve. I assume some basic Python programming experience, but try to keep everything acessible to those just getting started. Please feel free to contact me with any feedback or questions.
