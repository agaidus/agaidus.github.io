I am a data scientist with a background in quantitative policy analysis and GIS. I am particulary interested in spatial data systems and analysis; and am an enthusiastic user of Python for data science and open-source GIS. I grew up on the East Coast where I also attended college (Williams) and graduate school (Yale). The Bay Area is now home.

I currently working at a national public health research institute where I conduct statistical analyses and manage large-scale spatial data systems that measure spatial patterns in various health outcomes. I'm passionate about using data (particularly that which can be displayed on a map) to understand and solve complex problems.

On the weekends, I can generally be found in the Sierra Nevada camping, climbing, running, and hiking. 

## Motivation for this site
I've really come to value the ways that working in Python for data science allows me to address all aspects of a project within the same programming environment - data storage, spatial analysis, statistical analysis, visualization, etc. I find that using the SciPy stack along with open source spatial libraries to be an very useful and intuitive approach to any data science project. Especially with GIS, using the spatial libraries in Python as building blocks allows me to customize and tweak every detail of a particular application, leading to direct and efficient problem-solving. I truly find this process to be incredibly useful, enjoyable, and satisfying. 

In this blog, I hope to share some interesting things that I learn as I continue this journey. The motivation for a particular post could come fron anything I come across: an interesting dataset to play with, a new library to explore, a particular problem to solve, or a useful way of combining a set of tools together. I assume some basic Python programming experience, but try to keep everything acessible to those just getting started. Please feel free to contact me with any feedback or questions.
